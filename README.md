# Java-banking
A super simple and Super Basic java program based on Banking
The programs depicted here are basically for learning purpose

Our first program is based on simplest Banking facility called JAVA banking. The program file name is **Bank.java**
To run it follow the steps below - - - -

1) Open up your command line or command prompt. To open up the cmd press ``Win + R`` and type in __cmd__

2) The Command Prompt will open up on your screen. Then on the command prompt you need to set up the direcory of your java file. do ``cd [file directory]`` for example ``cd desktop/javaprogramms/``.

3) Once you are done setting up directories , do ``javac bank.java``. This step is where your JAVA program gets compiled and gives you the error if there are some...

4) Final step , type ``java Bank`` to run your program. Remeber that its case sensitive. In my case, my main class was with the name __Bank__ (**B** is uppercase) so i typed ``java Bank``. If you want to make your own program, dont forget the cases.

Once you finish doing this. Your program will run on the command prompt and will give you desired output.

**Remember that you should first install appropriate version of Java Development KIT on your computer or whatever you using to run it**.
